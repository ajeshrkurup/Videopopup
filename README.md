# Videopopup
Video popup / Modal Window which can be used to embed an youtube video.

My decision to start working on this project was influenced by a real time issue which my team faced. Following were the challenges we had to resolve and because we were working on a tight deadline, the product owner and all others involved in the project decided to do some compromise with respect to the accessiblity support. So I decided to continue with the project at home to develop a fully accessible video popup / modal window. 

Things I tried to address in this project. I'm still working on this, this is my first commit.

1.) Responsive model window
2.) Support to different Mobile / Tablet size.
3.) Accessibility with respect to screen readers, color contrast and so on.
